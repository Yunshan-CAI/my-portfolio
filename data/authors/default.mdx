Hi, I’m Yunshan Cai — a Master’s student in Creative Intelligence & Technology at Leiden University, with a background that bridges linguistics, software development, and AI.

I enjoy building things that connect people and technology — from full-stack platforms to computer vision prototypes. My recent work includes technical internships, programming projects, and creative explorations that combine code with real-world impact.

I’m currently based in the Netherlands and open to opportunities in **product management, digital operations, technical support and IT consulting**.

Outside of work, I’m a curious soul who loves cats, movies, writing, and that fresh smell of air after rain.

This site is where I share projects I’ve worked on, what I’ve learned along the way, and sometimes a glimpse of life beyond the screen. Thanks for stopping by!
