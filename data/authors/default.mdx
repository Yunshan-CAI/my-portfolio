Hey there, I'm Alicia Cai.

Female. Chinese. Living in the Netherlands. And a lot of other things...

I'm quite nerdy by nature. Here are some things I enjoy: cats, movies, the fresh smell of air after rain, writing, and diving into anything that gets me into a flow state.

In this space, I hope to share interesting projects I've worked on, knowledge I've gained along the way, and perhaps glimpses of my own life too.

Thanks for stopping by.
