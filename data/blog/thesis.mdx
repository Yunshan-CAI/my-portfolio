## Project Concept

This Media Technology MSc thesis investigates two interconnected research questions: **To what extent can AI fulfill the key responsibilities of a thesis supervisor**, and what are its strengths and limitations? Additionally, **how effectively can computer vision techniques detect nail biting behavior** through different computational approaches? With GenAI serving as my official secondary supervisor, this research explores whether AI can effectively guide graduate-level technical projects.

The methodology employs Lee (2008)'s academic supervision framework to evaluate AI performance across five key dimensions: functional guidance, academic enculturation, critical thinking support, emotional assistance, and technical implementation.

A nail biting detection project serves as the technical case study, where I develop and compare multiple computer vision approaches while documenting every AI interaction through structured logbooks. This dual-layer research design allows for systematic evaluation of AI supervision capabilities while producing concrete technical outcomes that demonstrate the practical effectiveness of machine-guided research.
