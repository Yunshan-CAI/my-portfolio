## Project Overview

This MSc thesis investigates two interconnected questions:

1. **To what extent can AI fulfill the key responsibilities of a thesis supervisor?**
2. **How effectively can computer vision techniques detect nail biting behavior?**

The project adopts a dual-layer design: AI supervision is evaluated using Leeâ€™s (2008) five-dimension framework, while a nail biting detection system serves as the technical case study.

## Implementation

### **AI Supervision Layer**

- AI (ChatGPT & Claude) acted as my secondary supervisor throughout the thesis.
- Tasks included academic guidance, methodology feedback, technical debugging, and emotional support.
- All interactions were documented and analyzed against Leeâ€™s framework.

### **Nail Biting Detection Layer**

- **Dataset**: 5,000+ annotated hand images from _11k Hands_ and web sources.
- **Approach**: Transfer learning on CNNs (ResNet34, MobileNet) using **fastai, PyTorch, OpenCV**.
- **Techniques**: Image augmentation, fine-tuning, class rebalancing.
- **Result**: Achieved >90% classification accuracy in distinguishing bitten vs. non-bitten nails.

## Key Contribution

This thesis demonstrates that AI can play a meaningful role in graduate-level supervision, while also delivering a working prototype for behavioral monitoring through computer vision.
