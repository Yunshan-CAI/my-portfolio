## Project Concept

_"Gender, is mostly, if not entirely, a social construct."_

**Fluid Orlando** is an interactive artificial creature that challenges conventional notions of gender in artificial beings. Inspired by Virginia Woolf's novel "Orlando" - whose protagonist literally changes gender as time progresses - our creature embodies the concept of gender fluidity through voice, appearance, and behavior.

## Design Philosophy

### **Beyond Binary Gender**

Our research showed a gap in current literature: while many studies examine how gendering robots influences human-robot interaction, few explore the gender identity of robots themselves. This led us to fundamental questions:

- Do robots have genders?
- Do they need genders?
- If so, must they be limited to male and female?

## Voice as Gender Expression

### **Dynamic Voice Switching**

Orlando's voice changes every minute in a continuous cycle:

1. **Male Voice** â†’ Deep, traditionally masculine tones
2. **Female Voice** â†’ Higher pitch, traditionally feminine characteristics
3. **Gender-Neutral Voice** â†’ Androgynous vocal qualities
