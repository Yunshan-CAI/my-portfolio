## Project Overview

How can we bridge the gap between traditional Chinese craftsmanship and modern digital creativity? Our Chinese Tuanshan Sketchpad is a co-creative system that empowers users to design authentic Chinese fans (Tuanshan) by combining human creativity with AI-generated content.

## Implementation

### **Core Features**

- **Interactive Canvas**: Mouse-based drawing with pressure sensitivity simulation
- **AI Poetry Generation**: Markov chain algorithm trained on classical Chinese poems
- **Dynamic Content**: Procedural flower generation inspired by traditional Chinese painting
- **Cultural Authenticity**: Traditional seals with Buddhist and philosophical meanings
- **Multilingual Typography**: Four traditional Chinese fonts for calligraphy customization

### **Technology Stack**

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with interactive canvas
- **Backend**: Python Flask with RESTful API design
- **AI Algorithm**: Markov Chain for Chinese poetry generation

### **AI-Human Collaboration Design**

- **Human Control**: Drawing, keyword input, element positioning, style selection
- **AI Assistance**: Poetry composition, flower pattern generation, content suggestions
