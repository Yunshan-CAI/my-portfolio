## Project Overview

The Game of the Goose (Ganzenbord) is a classic Dutch board game where players race to reach the final tile by rolling dice. We reimagined this traditional game as a large-scale interactive experience where real people serve as the game pieces, walking on a physical board equipped with sensors and LED lighting.

_For those non-Dutchies (as me), this is what the original ganzenbord looks like._

## Implementation

### **Gameplay Experience**

1. **Turn Taking**: Players roll a physical die and move the corresponding number of tiles
2. **Action Triggers**: When stepping on special tiles, LEDs immediately light up to show where to go
3. **Audio Feedback**: Each action is accompanied by thematic sound effects
4. **Multi-player**: Multiple players can be on the board simultaneously

### **Hardware Setup**

- **Arduino Uno**: Controls the entire system
- **LED Strips**: WS2812B addressable LEDs around each action tile
- **Sensors**: Light sensors (LDRs) under action tiles detect when players step on them
- **Sound**: Piezo buzzer for audio effects
- **Power**: External 5V supply for LED strips

### **How It Works**

1. **Detection**: When a player steps on an action tile, it blocks light from reaching the sensor underneath
2. **Processing**: Arduino reads the sensor change and determines which action to trigger
3. **Response**: LED strips light up around the destination tile while playing appropriate sounds
4. **Reset**: System waits for player to move, then resets for the next action
