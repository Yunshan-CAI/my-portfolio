## Project Concept

_"Live or get laid"_ - a stark choice that shows the perilous mating behavior of male mantises. **Echoes of Decision** transforms this fascinating biological phenomenon into an interactive installation that lets users experience the ultimate reproductive dilemma firsthand.

## Background

### **The Mantis Mating Paradox**

In certain mantis species, males face a reproductive challenge: the female may literally consume them during or after mating. This extreme behavior shows the evolutionary trade-off between **individual survival** and **reproductive success** - a phenomenon that provides insights into sexual selection and evolutionary strategies.

## How to Play

Players begin by taking a photo to create their mantis avatar, then select one of three female mantis profiles with varying danger levels. The core challenge is a **stealth approach game**: users must advance toward the female mantis by holding the movement button, but must immediately stop when she turns around. Being caught moving results in instant failure, while successfully reaching her leads to mating success - though the male mantis pays the ultimate price. Each female profile offers different difficulty levels, with more aggressive mantises turning around more frequently, requiring patience and careful timing to achieve reproductive success.

## Implementation

### **Technology Stack**

- **Primary Platform**: Processing 3.x (Java-based creative coding environment)
- **Computer Vision**: Processing Video library for webcam integration
