## üê± Research Overview

Do our feline companions form different types of emotional bonds with us based on their personalities? Our research explores the intersection of cat personality psychology and attachment theory, investigating whether individual differences in feline personalities influence their attachment styles toward human caregivers.

## Theoretical Background

### **Attachment Theory in Animals**

Building on foundational attachment research, our study applies **Bowlby's attachment theory** to human-cat relationships. Previous research has shown that cats exhibit distinct attachment styles toward their human caregivers, similar to patterns observed in human infant-caregiver relationships.

### **Feline Personality Research**

Research has identified **five main personality factors** in domestic cats:

- **Neuroticism** (anxiety levels)
- **Extraversion** (social engagement)
- **Dominance** (assertiveness)
- **Impulsiveness** (behavioral control)
- **Agreeableness** (social cooperation)

### **Research Question**

_"Do the personality traits of domestic cats correlate with their attachment styles towards human caregivers, and if so, how?"_

## üî¨ Methodology

### **Experimental Design**

Our study employed a **two-phase assessment protocol**:

#### **Phase 1: Cat Personality Test (CPT)**

- **35-question assessment** developed by IDRlabs
- **Five personality dimensions** measured through behavioral observations
- **Principal factor analysis** to determine personality scores

#### **Phase 2: Secure Base Test (SBT)**

Adapted from the classic "Strange Situation" paradigm:

1. **Phase 1** (2 min): Owner and cat together in unfamiliar room
2. **Phase 2** (2 min): **Separation** - Owner leaves, cat alone
3. **Phase 3** (2 min): **Reunion** - Owner returns

### **Behavioral Coding**

**Secure Attachment Indicators:**

- Separation distress in Phase 2 that diminishes in Phase 3
- Balanced contact-seeking and environmental exploration
- Observable stress signals: vocalization, tail position, door-waiting behavior

**Insecure Attachment Types:**

- **Ambivalent**: Excessive proximity-seeking in both phases
- **Avoidant**: Minimal separation distress, avoidance of owner
- **Disorganized**: Contradictory proximity-seeking and avoiding behaviors

## üìä Results & Analysis

### **Sample Characteristics**

- **Total participants**: 7 cats
- **Securely attached**: 4 cats (57%)
- **Insecurely attached**: 3 cats (43%)

### **Statistical Analysis**

Using **independent samples t-tests**, we compared personality trait scores between attachment groups:

**Key Findings:**

- No statistically significant differences between secure and insecure cats across all five personality traits
- All calculated t-values fell below critical thresholds
- Despite visual differences in the data (particularly in dominance), statistical power was insufficient to detect significant correlations

### **Personality Profile Comparison**

| Trait         | Secure Cats (Mean) | Insecure Cats (Mean) | Difference |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------- |
| Extraversion  | ~65                | ~60                  | Minimal    |
| Dominance     | ~55                | ~70                  | Notable    |
| Impulsiveness | ~60                | ~65                  | Small      |
| Agreeableness | ~70                | ~65                  | Small      |
| Neuroticism   | ~50                | ~55                  | Small      |
